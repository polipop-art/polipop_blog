				<h2>About something called motivation</h2>
				<p>Let me tell you a story, a story about you.</p>
				<p>
					Some day you just stopped, and start to ask yourself: were am I? what
					I'm doing? who am I?... That, is called conscience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wen people get conscience, have two ways to chose: the way of
					"feeling", and the way of "thinking". People than chose the feeling
					way just say: "you know, f*ck this sh*t, I just want to live, whatever
					has to happen than happen" and they become happy.
				</p>
				<p>
					People than decide think just suffer, cause they slowly start to being
					conscient about themselves, about they own feelings, they slowly start
					to being consents about they past, they present and they future, and
					keep suffer. But, as slowly as is posible they start to see things
					than other people cant's see, can see themselves and the people around
					they. Start to see they future, and suddenly, the fear is gone,
					suddenly they have the answer to the questions: "who I'm?" "what I
					want to do?" now they know.
				</p>
				<p>
					And if yow was that guy in the pass sure you start to laugh and said:
					"Oh dude, I was so dummy in that time, I was a disaster hahaha".
				</p>
				<p>
					Now let me tell you something else, that one than decide feel and that
					one than decide think, they meet again, and exchange paths.
				</p>
				<p>
					After think a loot you decide start to feel. Cause you know than is
					time, time to enjoy a bit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The person than decided feel, know than is time to reflect about they
					past, living the present one day at time, and preparing for the
					future.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the end, we all need to walk the two paths. And in the end of they
					way, you know one thing: with your head up, you must keep going,
					where?... ahead on towards life. you found it, found what?...
				</p>
				<p>That is we call, motivation, motivation to live.</p>
				<p>
					Motivation for me, is not to suffer for the past, and chase a shining
					future. "I want a better future for all around me, and I will get it"
